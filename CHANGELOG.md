## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The `true_async` module: builds with `phpize` against a core built from `async-core-io`, and
  inside the core tree on Windows; `configure` stops on a core without the scheduler API.
- INI `true_async.enable` (system, default `0`): the extension registers as the core's scheduler
  only when it is on.
- A `phpinfo()` section with the version and the INI entries.
