# Security

What True Async must not let happen, how every stage is checked for it, and the decisions taken.
Newest journal entry last.

## Threat model

True Async runs inside the PHP process, in every request, under user code. The defect classes:

1. **Memory safety.** Use after free, double free, overflow in the extension's C code; the risky
   places are coroutine lifetimes across a switch, a bailout and a request end. Consequence: a crash
   or code execution in the PHP process.
2. **State leaking between coroutines.** Engine state that belongs to one coroutine and is seen by
   another: `EG(error_handling)`, the current exception, output buffers, the current coroutine.
   Precedent: in TrueAsync the EH_THROW window was process-wide, and a warning raised in one
   coroutine surfaced as a `PDOException` in another.
3. **Denial of service.** Unbounded queues and handler vectors, spawn storms, the cost of deadlock
   detection, stack memory per coroutine, a scheduler loop that spins with nothing to run.
4. **Cancellation bypass.** A cancellation that skips `finally` handlers or leaks out of `protect()`
   leaves locks held and resources open.
5. **Supply chain and CI.** Secrets written into artifacts, downloads not pinned, a workflow token
   with write rights.

Out of scope: defects in php-src and ior themselves. They are reported to their owners: php-src
under its security policy (the core's `SECURITY.md`), bukka's projects through his repositories.

## The security pass

Every T2 stage closes with a security pass after Code Reviewer (`WORKFLOW.md`). A subagent gets
this file and the stage diff and checks:

- the lifetime of every object across a switch, a bailout and a request end (a green ASAN lane is
  necessary, not sufficient: it sees only the paths the tests take);
- every refcount pair on the paths an exception or a bailout takes;
- every piece of engine state saved and restored per coroutine;
- every size or count that user code controls has a bound or a documented reason to have none;
- every new INI entry: who can set it (`PHP_INI_SYSTEM` or `PHP_INI_ALL`) and what it enables;
- test-only code (known-answer functions, fuzz hooks) compiled out of a default build;
- CI: new downloads pinned by revision or hash, no secrets, read-only permissions.

The main model answers each finding: fixed with a test, or recorded below with the reason. A
finding left open gets an owner step in `PLAN.md`.

## Journal

- 2026-10-01 The runner removes secret-looking variables from the tests' environment. Why: run-tests
  writes the whole environment into a `.sh` next to every failed test; 45 such files holding a
  GitHub token were found in the local core trees and deleted.
- 2026-10-01 The CI workflow token is read-only (`permissions: contents: read`). Why: no job
  writes to the repository.
- 2026-10-01 CI downloads are pinned: the core and ior by full commit, Mull's package by sha256
  (equal to the release's published digest). Why: a moved tag or a replaced asset would change
  what CI builds and runs.
- 2026-10-01 The planted known-answer functions are built only with
  `--enable-true-async-known-answer`. Why: they are PHP-callable functions with no purpose in a
  default build.
- 2026-10-01 `true_async.enable` is `PHP_INI_SYSTEM`. Why: user code must not switch the
  process-wide scheduler on or off at run time.

## Open findings

- The secret filter of `tools/test.py` matches names (`TOKEN`, `SECRET`, `_KEY`, `GITHUB_`, …); a
  secret under another name still reaches the `.sh` files in `results/`. Owner: S3.14.
