--TEST--
Scope cancellation with double-exception case in finally handlers execution
--DESCRIPTION--
This test triggers a double-exception case: first in the coroutine, and then in the finally handler.
--FILE--
<?php

use function Async\spawn;
use function Async\suspend;
use function Async\await;

echo "start\n";

$scope = new \Async\Scope();

// Spawn coroutine with finally handlers

    echo "coroutine with finally started\n";
    
    $coroutine = \Async\current_coroutine();

    $coroutine->finally(function() {
        echo "finally handler 3 executed\n";
        // This might throw during cancellation cleanup
        throw new \RuntimeException("Finally handler error");
    });
    
    suspend();
    echo "coroutine should not complete normally\n";
    return "normal_result";
