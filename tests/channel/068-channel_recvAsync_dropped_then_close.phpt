--TEST--
Channel: recvAsync() Future dropped, then channel closes — close path skips freed waiter
--FILE--
<?php

use function Async\spawn;
use function Async\await;

$ch = new Async\Channel(0);

$future = $ch->recvAsync();
$future->ignore();
unset($future);
echo "future dropped\n";

// channel_close() walks all queued future waiters and rejects them. With the
// fix, the dropped future already removed its waiter from the queue, so the
// close-time iteration is empty. The close runs in a coroutine of its own and
// is awaited rather than timed: what matters is that it happens after the
// future is gone, not how long either takes.
$closer = spawn(function () use ($ch) {
